# **Performance Based Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (“QASP”)**

# **TTS Bug Bounty**

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan ("QASP") has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing [the Performance Work Statement](003_PWS.md) ("PWS"). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements Matrix in the call order. It also provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish. 

## 2.0 STANDARD

The contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the CO/COR is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. The contractor shall perform all work required in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the requirements of the PWS. The COR shall notify the CO for appropriate action if it is likely that the contractor will not achieve successful final delivery of the software code in accordance with the performance objectives and acceptable quality levels ("AQLs") identified below.

### 2.1 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS MATRIX

The CO/COR will evaluate the performance objectives through surveillance as reflected below by reviews and acceptance of work products and services. Note that the performance requirements listed throughout the length of the period of performance. Deliverable or Required Services Performance Standard(s):

**Deliverable or Required Services** | **Performance Standard(s)** | **Acceptable Quality Level (AQL)** | **Method of Surveillance**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Vulnerability Reports | Average time-to-triage initial reports | > 95% triaged within 1 business day | Timestamps within platform and information included in monthly report
Vulnerability Reports | Triage accuracy | 90% of valid reports triaged correctly | TTS manual assessment of report triage and concurrence with the severity rating and category
Vulnerability Reports | Minimal false negatives | No more than 5% false negatives (alid reports improperly classified as invalid or duplicate) | TTS manual assessment of report triage and concurrence with the severity rating and category

### 2.2 PROCEDURES

The CO/COR, along with the TTS Product Owner, will inspect all tasks required by the call order to ensure contractor compliance with the solicitation requirements at the conclusion of every month. 

At the conclusion of month, the CO/COR, along with the TTS Product Owner, will review the reported vulnerabilities.
At the conclusion of the period of performance, a similar procedure will be followed to document discrepancies and to assess overall performance.

If any of the services do not conform to the call order requirements, the CO/COR may require the contractor to perform the services again in conformity with solicitation requirements. The CO/COR shall not certify satisfactory performance for the call order until all defects have been corrected. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:

1.  Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to solicitation  requirements; and,

2.  Reduce the solicitation price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. The CO/COR shall, in addition to providing documentation to the CO, maintain a complete quality assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions relating to the Government’s performance of the quality assurance function, including originals of all surveillance activity checklists. All such records will be retained for the life of the call order. The CO/COR shall forward these records to the CO at completion or termination of the call order.

### 2.3 ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICES

Acceptance of services shall be based upon compliance with performance standards described in the PWS and surveillance procedures described in this QASP. Before approving/certifying any contractor invoices, the CO/COR will verify that all invoiced services have been performed in compliance with call order requirements. The CO/COR shall not certify satisfactory performance for the call order until all defects have been corrected.
