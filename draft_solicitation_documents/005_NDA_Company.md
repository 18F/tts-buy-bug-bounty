6. **Duties Respecting Third Parties.** If [CONTRACTOR] will have access to the proprietary information of other companies in performing Task Order support services for the Government, [CONTRACTOR] shall enter into agreements with the other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.

7. **Notice Concerning Organizational Conflicts of Interest.** [CONTRACTOR] agrees that distribution, disclosure or dissemination  of Confidential Information (whether authorized or unauthorized) within its corporate organization or affiliates, may lead to disqualification from participation in future Government procurements under the organizational conflict of interest rules of 48 C.F.R. § 9.5.
