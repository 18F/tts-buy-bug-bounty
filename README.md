# TTS Bug Bounty

This repository was created in the hopes that government agencies -- from Federal to state to local municipalities -- can include a bug bounty program in their security plans. We have included our internal [acquisition documents](acquisition_documents) as well as our public facing [solicitation documents](solicitation_documents). The [README](SOLICITATION_README.md) file we used for the solicitation itself has also been preserved for the convenience of our partners.

## Background

As part of its programmatic focus on security, the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) (TTS) needs to purchase access to a pre-existing, commercially available Bug Bounty SaaS Platform that will allow it to launch and manage the TTS Bug Bounty program. This acquisition will give TTS access to a large network of security researchers, people who have an interest - both personally and financially - in helping to find and address bugs and other technical issues within TTS-owned web applications.

### What we're hoping to end up with

The purpose of this repository is to provide government agencies (and even private industry partners) the ability to learn from our experiences and implement a bug bounty program of their own. We are hoping to streamline this process and allow for a rapid and responsible roll-out of vulnerability disclosure policies and bug bounty programs nationwide.
